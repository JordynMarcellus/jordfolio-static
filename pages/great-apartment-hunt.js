          COVID-19 has caused many people across Toronto to search for more
          space; we're no different. We remain committed to making Toronto a
          great place to live, and that means we want to find our own great
          place to thrive in this new normal.

          We've lived in the same cozy Annex apartment for the last ten years,
          and want to use this moment in time as an opportunity to find a new
          space to kick off this new decade.

          Our budget follows Canadian Mortgage Housing Corporation's affordable
          housing guidelines; therefore, we've set our maximum budget at
          $3000/month. Our needs, the things that are non-negotiable include:
          <ul>
            <li>Private outdoor space (e.g. balcony, backyard)</li>
            <li>2 bedrooms</li>
            <li>Downtown (Dufferin -> Don, Dupont -> water)</li>
            <li>A bathtub -- no creepy shower stalls!</li>
            <li>Laundry in building</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          We also have more than a few wants -- things we'd like to have in an
          ideal space, but are willing to compromise on.
          <ul>
            <li>Large kitchen</li>
            <li>1000+ sqft</li>
            <li>3 bedrooms</li>
            <li>home or townhouse</li>
            <li>Ensuite laundry</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          And a few hard nos:
          <ul>
            <li>No basement apartments -- we're terrified of centipedes ðŸ’€</li>
          </ul>
